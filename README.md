[![Build Status](https://www.travis-ci.org/drougge/travistest.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.org/drougge/travistest)

I just wanted a playground repo for testing [travis-ci](https://www.travis-ci.org/).

I'm putting it under an MIT license not because there's any reason for
anyone else to want this, but just as a default. (Plus I guess travis-ci is
only free for open source projects.)
